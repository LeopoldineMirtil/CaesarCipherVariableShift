# Caesar Cipher with Variable Shift

The user is prompted to input the number of characters to shift first. Then the user is asked to enter a sentence to be encrypted and the output is the encrypted sentence. 

The program converts the plain text sentence into lowercase for efficiency. It also leaves punctuation and special characters unchanged.
